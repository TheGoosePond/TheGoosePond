				<h2>GUZO: The Person</h2>
				<p>Guzo is an 16 year old Icelandic Pop singer/songwriter and producer. At the age of 14 he started making music on just his guitar, Keyboard and using audacity to mix it all together. but even before then he was always singing his own lyrics to popular songs or just making music with garageband on a school ipad so you could say that music has always been apart of his life.</p>
				<p>Guzo tried a handful of daws after audacity. He tried using FL Studio but could never make anything good. He tried ableton but it was way too confusing for him. on the 6th of july, while in a music store with his grandma, He noticed a drum machine and said he would wanna get one someday but his grandmother just bought it for him right then and there. When Guzo came home and plugged everything in, He noticed that the drum machine came with a daw called "Studio One"</p>
				<p>and it fit perfectly for Guzo</p>

                <h2>PURPLE SKY</h2>
                <p>"Purple sky was released on December 29th, 2020. The EP was more of a collection of songs and demos made by me rather than an official release with most songs being very underproduced and it having very amateur singing.</p>
                <blockquote>The EP had just 6 songs but due to the length of the final track, PAST PRESENT FUTURE with a whopping 9 minutes and 20 seconds of runtime; The EP ended up at 25:20 minutes length.</blockquote>
                <p>The making of the EP was a very abrupt and rushed process. Throughout the second half of 2020, I was making a lot music in my freetime. On Dec 25th while on a walk, I was listening to my songs back to back using google drive and had the sudden need to put the songs together and release it as an album or EP, and so I did.
                </p>
                <p>I decided Immedietly that I was going to release these songs before it was new years and so I rushed back home to create what is now known as "PURPLE SKY". Due to only having 6 days to make it, it ended up being released in a very bad state. it was originally released with 8 songs on it but after it's release it became apparent that I did NOT like 2 songs on this project so I removed them around a week later.</p>
                <p>It was the first music project I had ever made and actually put out and it turned out pretty well in my eyes for only being made into an EP in a couple days and having songs that were made a day before it's release"</p>

                <h2>PYNK SKY</h2>
                <p>"Pynk sky was released on July 7th 2021. The project included themes of Space, Time and mixing them with stories from reality. Only 6 months after purple sky, PYNK SKY was an IMMENSE improvement from purple sky in every way.</p>
                <blockquote>The creation of this album was way more professional in the sense that it wasn't made in 6 days but rather 6 months which is a LOT better than the rushed and unprofessional making of purply sky.</blockquote>  
				<p>From the very beginnning, I wanted this album to have a concept rather then it just being a compilation of songs. The first song that was made was a song called "Afresh". An electro Pop single which I put on soundcloud first before I even knew I was going to make an album.</p>
				<p>I had gotten a lot better at making music so I wanted to try making a better version of purple sky. You might have been able to notice that galaxy is on both albums because all I really did was just sing better and made it more bombastic but something I don't think anyone has noticed is how LIFT OFF's arpeggio is the same as in SAME LOVE but much slower</p>
				<p>I made LIFT OFF and I Immedietly wanted to make an album about space, and so I did. worked on the album for around 3-4 months and by the end I decided I wanted to have AFRESH and LITTLE SHIBA on the record even though it wasn't really as space themed as the rest.</p>
				<p>As of writing of this, PYNK SKY is my only album I've made. But what have I been doing for the last 7 months?</p>

				<h2>Burning Down</h2>
				<p>A big change in sound. A different dimension and a complete switch from the elustrious and space themed sound that was prevelant on PYNK SKY and Purple Sky. Burning Down is the first single I've made but it's not the only one of it's kind. An album that has been in the work for over 6 months is now almost ready and Burning Down is just a little taste of what's present on the next album.</p>
				<p>With inspirations from artists such as:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Death Grips</li>
					<li>JPEGMAFIA</li>
					<li>Kanye west</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The album is weird, experimental and angry. Burning Down is the only hint of what it sounds like so far. The song has a bitcrush sound to it and a mix between hip-hop and Pop which will also be the case for the rest of the album</p>
				<p>Burning Down is all about being in a situation which makes you feel burnt out. whether it be your job, Relationships or maybe even yourself. The song focused mostly on the relationship aspect because that's what I was burnt out by while writing the song.</p>
