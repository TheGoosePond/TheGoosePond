				<h2>PURPLE SKY</h2>
				<p>Purple sky was released on December 29th. The EP was more of a collection of songs and demos made by me rather than an official release with most songs being very underproduced and it having very amateur singing.</p>
				<blockquote>The EP had just 6 songs but due to the length of the final track; PAST PRESENT FUTURE with a whopping 9:20 minutes of runtime, The EP ended up at 25:20 minutes length.</blockquote>
				<p>The making of the EP was a very abrupt and rushed process. throughout the second half of 2020, I was making a lot music in my freetime. on Dec 25th while on a walk, I was listening to my songs back to back using google drive and had the sudden need to put the songs together and release it as an album or EP and so I did.
				</p>
				<p>I decided Immedietly that I was going to release these songs before it was new years and so I rushed back home to create what is now known as "PURPLE SKY". Due to only having 6 days to make it, it ended up being released in a very bad state. it was originally released with 8 songs on it but after it's release it became apparent that I did NOT like 2 songs on this project so I removed them around a week later.</p>
				<p>It was the first music project I had ever made and actually put out and it turned out pretty well in my eyes for only being made into an EP in a couple days and having songs that were made a day before it's release</p>

				<h2>PYNK SKY</h2>
                <p>Pynk sky was released on July 7th 2021. The project included themes of Space, Time and mixing them with stories from reality. Only 6 months after purple sky, PYNK SKY was an IMMENSE improvement from purple sky in every way.</p>
				<blockquote>The creation of this album was way more professional in the sense that it wasn't made in 6 days but rather 6 months which is a LOT better than the rushed and unprofessional making of purply sky.</blockquote>
